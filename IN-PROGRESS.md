# In Progress — Lumen (lumen-tv)

Last updated: 2026-10-13

## Where we are
Lumen's UI is Slint (femtovg), 60 fps at 1080p60 and 4K60 on the TV. M3 done (2026-10-13): app registry with icon tiles; Jellyfin/Plex (Chromium kiosk), Steam Link and Kodi launch from Lumen; keep-alive/exclusive policies; Home (keyboard F1) works from any app and pauses its media; auto-return when an app dies. **Next: M3.5 = Settings/diagnostics screen + the LG TV remote working everywhere** (Gate confirmed by Laith 2026-10-13, see MILESTONES.md). Then M4 Store → M4.5 controllers + Bluetooth pairing screen → M5 boot session. Kodi still boots by default; Lumen runs from `lumen-test.service`.

## Active Plan
Build M3.5 → M4 → M4.5 → M5 in order (see MILESTONES.md), stopping after each one for a TV test.

Layout (as built; `store.rs`, `store.slint`/`details.slint` arrive in M4, `settings.slint` in M3.5):
```
lumen-tv/
  Cargo.toml, build.rs     one crate; slint-build compiles ui/
  src/
    main.rs                window setup, Slint callbacks, input gate, bench hook
    session.rs             glue: lifecycle + windows + tiles (UI thread)
    apps.rs                Lifecycle planner (pure, tested) + process control, MPRIS pause
    registry.rs, icons.rs  app TOMLs; icon lookup + bake onto tiles
    bake.rs, bench.rs      CPU-baked images; LUMEN_BENCH frame-time bench
    input/                 evdev reader, hotplug, mapping loader, repeat/deadzone, dispatch
    platform/mod.rs        traits: Windows, Tv
    platform/pi.rs         CEC remote claim (cec-ctl)
    platform/toplevel.rs   labwc wlr-foreign-toplevel
  ui/                      app.slint (screens, focus; Store/Settings tiles do nothing yet), tile.slint, theme.slint
  config/input/            keyboard, xbox, playstation, gamepad, cec-remote (.toml)
  config/apps/             default registry entries
  examples/                fake-pad.rs, press.rs, toplevels.rs (gate tools)
  session/                 labwc rc.xml, start-lumen.sh, lumen-test.service, sudoers
  scripts/pi-build.sh      rsync to pitv + cargo build --release there
```

Decisions so far:
- Registry in `~/.config/lumen-tv/apps/` (XDG config dir: user-editable, survives reinstalls, no root needed). Mapping defaults ship in the app; user overrides go in `~/.config/lumen-tv/input/`.
- Build Rust natively on the Pi (simplest; no cross toolchain).
- Window control through labwc's wlr-foreign-toplevel-management protocol (activate/close), behind `platform::Windows`.
- Input → UI: evdev reader thread calls `slint::invoke_from_event_loop` to deliver normalized events to UI callbacks.

## Settled
- (2026-10-08) UI is Slint 1.18, femtovg renderer, winit backend under labwc. Not Skia: slower at both resolutions, and its default wgpu/Vulkan surface never fires the rendering notifier.
- (2026-10-08) Lumen is GPLv3 (Slint's royalty-free license excludes embedded systems).
- (2026-10-08) Port before M2. Kiosk browser for `fallback_url` = Chromium (M3).
- (2026-10-08) 4K60 works with baked images (59.7 fps, 0.4% slow). Default output stays 1080p60 for now (Laith); `LUMEN_MODE=3840x2160@60` picks 4K.
- (2026-10-06) Kodi stays as a Lumen tile (close-on-exit, exclusive) for Games/YouTube/Mirror until replacements exist.
- (2026-10-06) Rust 1.99 via rustup (`~/.cargo/bin`) on the Pi and the Mac (not on the Mac's PATH). apt packages need Laith's sudo.
- (2026-10-06) Store manifest lives in this repo: github.com/Novapool/lumen-tv, `store/manifest.json` (raw URL once pushed).
- (2026-10-06) Pi 5 has 8 GB RAM. laith is already in the `input` group. TV native mode is 3840x2160; Lumen sets 1080p60 by default with `wlr-randr` (`LUMEN_MODE` overrides it).

- (2026-10-09) Clients run as children of Lumen in labwc (env XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/1000, WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-0, DISPLAY=:0 via Xwayland). All raise/close/fullscreen via foreign-toplevel:
  - Jellyfin: web client in Chromium (`http://192.168.5.174:8096`, app_id `lumen-jellyfin`), TV layout set once via `localStorage.layout = "tv"` in its profile (`~/.local/share/lumen-tv/browser/jellyfin`). Jellyfin Desktop (Flathub) was dropped as the launcher (still installed, for its icon): no GPU in its Mesa (software rendering, very slow) and its player showed subtitles with no video/audio.
  - Web apps get their own Chromium profile and app_id `lumen-<id>` (`{id}` in the browser command); otherwise a second launch hands off to the running Chromium and exits.
  - Plex: Chromium kiosk, app_id `lumen-plex`, ~1.7 GB (F1 is swallowed in rc.xml, so Chrome help no longer opens).
  - Steam Link: `steamlink` (Xwayland), app_id `SteamLink`; launcher script exits at once, real app `~/.local/share/SteamLink/bin/shell` reparented to PID 1.
  - Kodi: `kodi --windowing=wayland`, app_id `Kodi`, real app `kodi.bin`, close takes 4.5 s.

- (2026-10-09) Audio: PipeWire (`pipewire pipewire-pulse pipewire-alsa wireplumber`, user services) mixes for the HDMI output (vc4-hdmi-0, volume 100%). Without it Chromium's second audio stream got "Device or resource busy" and played silently (the Pi 5 HDMI PCM has no mixing). Kodi/Steam Link with pipewire-alsa still to be checked.
- (2026-10-09) Startup race: if Lumen starts before HDMI-A-1 is ready, `start-lumen.sh` can't set the mode and Lumen's window comes up tiny, top-left, not fullscreen (labwc "invalid output set for view"). Fixed in 2.1: `start-lumen.sh` waits up to ~5 s for the output, and Lumen asks for fullscreen on its own window if it comes up windowed.

- (2026-10-10) Registry (`~/.config/lumen-tv/apps/*.toml`, defaults in `config/apps/`, seeded on first run; fields in `src/registry.rs`, unknown keys rejected): `id`, `name`, `type` (`command`|`url`), `launch`, `url`, `fallback_url`, `background` (`keep-alive`|`close-on-exit`), `exclusive`, `icon`, `app_id`, `process` (real process name when the launcher exits at once, e.g. Steam Link's `shell`), `glyph`, `colors`, `order`. `url` apps run through `LUMEN_BROWSER` (default: Chromium kiosk with per-app profile and `--class=lumen-<id>`; `{id}` and `{url}` are substituted). Icon lookup: a path under `~/.config/lumen-tv/icons/`, else a hicolor theme name (svg, then largest png); on a miss the tile shows its glyph. No brand artwork ships: Plex keeps its glyph until Laith adds a file; Jellyfin's icon (`org.jellyfin.JellyfinDesktop`) resolves only while the Flathub Jellyfin Desktop stays installed.
- (2026-10-10) `session/labwc/rc.xml` swallows F1 and Super_L so clients (Chromium help) never see Home. The action must be `Execute command="true"`, since `None` clears the binding. Gate tools: `examples/press.rs`, `examples/toplevels.rs`.
- (2026-10-13) Home from a keep-alive app sends MPRIS Pause (`busctl --user`, players owned by the app's process tree). Reselect does not auto-resume (Laith).

## Slint rules (from the spike)
- Never animate a drop shadow's size or blur: the blur re-renders every frame (56.5 fps, 5.2% slow). Keep the shadow box fixed and fade it with `opacity`. Slint draws no shadow for an unfilled Rectangle, so fill it and hide it behind the face.
- Slint redraws only on change: frame stats count only frames while something is animating.
- No "hold" animation workaround needed (that was a WebKit compositor bug).
- Radial gradients are circles only.
- Bake gradients, gloss and shadows into images (`src/bake.rs`); the Pi 5 GPU is fill-rate bound and can't draw them live at 4K.
- Slint drops a texture once nothing shows it, so keep the images that change per focus move small (heroes are 640×234 and scaled up).
- Never crossfade two full-screen layers on the GPU: blend the two baked backdrops on the CPU (`bake::blend`) and draw one Image.
- `if`-created drop-shadow elements re-blur every time they are created; use one fixed shadow Image and fade it.

## Current Work
- M3.5 not started. Kickoff brief below (Next Steps 1). No AGENT_JOBS.md exists yet.

## Known issues
- After `systemctl stop lumen-test`, its ExecStopPost starts Kodi: wait until kodi is active before starting a test unit again.
- `ssh pitv` uses the IP (192.168.1.60), since `pitv.local` (mDNS) doesn't resolve over the VPN.
- `/dev/uinput` is writable by the input group: `cargo run --release --example fake-pad [secs]` on the Pi tests the input layer without a controller.
- Perf lines log under `labwc[...]`, so grep the whole journal, not `-u lumen-test`.
- Don't run wf-recorder on the Pi: its frames come out garbled and it froze the TV output.
- History: the WebKit focus-change flash/snap (compositor drew pre-animation values for ~2 frames) was patched with "hold" animations (95dc6f9); gone since the Slint port.
- Benchmark: put `LUMEN_BENCH=1` in `~/.config/lumen-tv/env` (runs on every start; remove it after), or press B on the home screen.

- Home (`KEY_F1`/`KEY_LEFTMETA`) is read from evdev, so the focused app also receives it unless rc.xml swallows it (F1 and Super_L are; `KEY_HOMEPAGE` is not).
- Steam Link needs Xwayland, and labwc must be restarted after installing it (restart `lumen-test`).
- Flatpak apps: the launched process is a wrapper, so descendants (`bwrap`/app) may outlive close; set `process` and check the terminate path before shipping one.

## Blockers
- (none)
- Bench is thermally sensitive: the Pi has no fan; after long builds it throttles at 75-82 C and 4K drops to 45-55 fps (a cool 4K run passed at 60). Let it cool before benching.

## Next Steps
1. **M3.5 kickoff (orchestrator, cold start).** Read MILESTONES.md M3.5 (scope + confirmed Gate), this file's Settled / Slint rules / Known issues, and `../CLAUDE.md` (Pi access, sudo rules). Then write AGENT_JOBS.md. Suggested shape:
   - **Phase 0, remote probe (needs Laith at the TV, no code):** with lumen-test running, record what the LG remote sends: `evtest /dev/input/event5` + `cec-ctl -d /dev/cec0 -M` while Laith presses every button (Up/Down/Left/Right/OK/Back/Home/Exit/Menu/Play/Pause/colours). Retry with `cec-ctl --playback --vendor-id 0x00e091` and other device types if Back/Home stay silent. Ask Laith whether Back works under plain Kodi; if so, capture what libcec announces. Output: the real key table, the chosen Home key (or the fallback Laith picks), and whether Chromium reacts to KEY_OK/KEY_EXIT. sudo for cec-ctl is likely needed: give Laith the commands.
   - **Phase 1, parallel builders:** (a) remote: fix the CEC claim in `platform/pi.rs`, trim `cec-remote.toml`, rc.xml swallow for the Home key, key remaps for Chromium if needed, re-claim after Kodi exits (`session.rs` on Kodi's exit); (b) Settings screen: new `ui/settings.slint` + a Rust data feed (fps from bench, input devices + last action from `input/`, registry errors from `registry.rs`, `Lifecycle::snapshot()` already exists for running apps, log tail), toggles for input debug and bench; keep to the Slint rules (no live shadows/gradients; 59 fps gate).
   - **Phase 2:** review/simplify/tests, then build on the Pi (`scripts/pi-build.sh`, `cargo test --release` on the Pi), automated checks (bench with Settings open), then Laith's TV checklist = the Gate.
2. Parked: controllers + Bluetooth pairing screen are M4.5; boot session is M5. Don't start them in M3.5.

## Recently Completed
- M3 Registry + launching + icons (2026-10-13): gate passed on the Pi and at the TV (Home 2–7 ms, same-PID reselect 5/5, exclusive kill 1.2 s, SSH kill → Lumen 23 ms, Steam Link smooth with sound). Late fixes: F1 swallowed in labwc (665c03d), Steam Link window swap (2458926), Home pauses media via MPRIS (bb61e09). Result line in MILESTONES.md.
- 4K bake merge (2026-10-08): `exp/baked-hero` merged into main (0abbe64). 4K60 59.7 fps / 0.4% > 25 ms / p95 17.4 ms (was 27.8 fps); 1080p60 60.0 / 0.1% / p95 17.1. M2 input kept; HDMI remote verified at 4K. Default stays 1080p. Branch, worktree and `~/lumen-bake` on the Pi removed.
- M1.5 Slint port (2026-10-08): gate passed (60.0 fps, 0.1% > 25 ms, Laith: no artifacts). Spike branch tagged `spike-slint-2026-10-08`, worktree and Pi test files removed.
